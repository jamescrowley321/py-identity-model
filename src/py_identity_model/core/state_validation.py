State and issuer validation for OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authorization callbacks.

Provides constant-time comparison of the ``state`` parameter to prevent
CSRF attacks on authorization callbacks (RFC 6749 Section 10.12), and
validation of the ``iss`` authorization-response parameter to defend
against mix-up attacks (RFC 9207).

    """Validate the ``iss`` parameter from an authorization callback (RFC 9207).

    RFC 9207 adds an ``iss`` parameter to authorization responses so a client
    can bind the response to the authorization server that issued it, closing
    the "mix-up" attack class (RFC 9207 Section 1, Section 4) where a response
    from a malicious/compromised AS is replayed at an honest AS's callback.

    Checks are performed in priority order:

    1. **Error response** — if the authorization server returned an error,
       validation fails with ``ERROR_RESPONSE`` (mirrors state validation;
       there is no issuer to validate on an error).
    2. **Issuer present** — when the callback carries ``iss``, it MUST match
       *expected_issuer* (RFC 9207 Section 2.4: "the client MUST validate").
       This holds even when the metadata flag is unset — a present ``iss``
       is always validated, never ignored. "Present" means the parameter was
       supplied at all: a present-but-empty ``iss`` (``...&iss=``) is
       malformed and validated (and thus rejected), not folded into the
       "absent" branch. A missing/empty *expected_issuer* yields
       ``ISSUER_MISMATCH`` (fail closed: we cannot confirm the response's
       origin).
    3. **Issuer absent** — when the AS advertises support
       (*iss_parameter_supported*) or the caller opts into strict mode
       (*require*), an absent ``iss`` fails with ``MISSING_ISSUER`` (the
       server promised it / the caller demands it). Otherwise there is
       nothing to validate and the result is ``SUCCESS``.

    Unlike state, the issuer is not a secret, so a plain ``==`` comparison is
    used — constant-time comparison would guard a timing side-channel that
    does not exist here (contrast ``validate_authorize_callback_state``).

    Args:
        response: A parsed ``AuthorizeCallbackResponse``.
        expected_issuer: The ``issuer`` the client expects, typically
            ``DiscoveryDocumentResponse.issuer`` for the AS the request was
            sent to. May be ``None`` when unknown.
        iss_parameter_supported: Whether the AS advertises
            ``authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported`` in its
            metadata. When ``True``, an absent ``iss`` is treated as a
            failure.
        require: Strict opt-in. When ``True``, ``iss`` is required
            regardless of advertised metadata support.
