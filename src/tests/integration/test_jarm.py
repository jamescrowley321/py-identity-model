"""Integration tests for JARM — JWT-Secured Authorization Response Mode (#218).

These hit the live OIDC provider fixture.  A *positive* JARM roundtrip needs an
interactive browser login to obtain a provider-signed ``response`` JWT, which
this headless fixture cannot drive non-interactively (same gap class as the
live DPoP/mTLS handshake tests — see the T126 precedent).  What we CAN exercise
against the real provider without a browser:

* the discovery document really advertises the JARM signing algorithms and the
  ``*.jwt`` response modes, and the typed model parses them (RFC 8414 §2); and
* ``process_jarm_response`` in discovery mode really fetches the provider's
  discovery + JWKS and rejects a response signed by an untrusted key.

The full signature/claims verification is covered exhaustively by the offline
unit tests (``src/tests/unit/test_jarm.py``) which mint their own keys.
