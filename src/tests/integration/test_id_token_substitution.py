"""Real-OP validation of the F-07 ID-token-substitution discriminator.

The FastAPI ``TokenValidationMiddleware`` gained an opt-in defence
(``require_access_token_marker``) that rejects a validated token carrying no
*positive* access-token marker claim — closing the gap where a code-flow ID
token (no nonce/at_hash/c_hash, ``aud == client_id``) is replayed as a bearer
access token. Its default marker set is ``("scope", "scp")``.

That defence is only safe if, for a real provider, the marker set actually
separates a genuine ID token from a genuine access token: the ID token must NOT
carry it (else the fix would be a no-op) and the access token MUST carry it
(else the fix would falsely reject real access tokens). The middleware logic
itself is deterministic and unit-tested against mocked claims; this test proves
the premise on REAL tokens minted against whatever provider ``--env-file``
selects, across the CI provider matrix.

Lives in the core integration suite (``src/tests -m integration``) because that
is where the real-token fixtures and the running OP fixtures are — the fastapi
package is not synced into this environment, so the middleware is not imported;
its decision predicate is mirrored locally and kept in lockstep by this test.
