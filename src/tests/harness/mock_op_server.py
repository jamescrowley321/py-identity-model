"""Serve the framework-free :class:`~mock_op.MockOP` over real localhost HTTP.

The RS boot (:func:`~rs_server.boot_rs`) launches uvicorn as a *subprocess*, so
it cannot reach an in-process ASGI mock OP — it fetches discovery + JWKS over
real HTTP. This helper runs the mock OP on a real loopback port so the booted RS
can validate against it.

The mock OP must run **in-process** (a uvicorn thread, not a subprocess): the
forged corpus (:func:`~corpus.build_corpus`) is keyed to the *same* ``MockOP``
instance's signing key, and a subprocess mock OP would re-import a fresh random
key, breaking every forgery.

``import uvicorn`` is deferred into the function so that plain unit-env
collection of importers does not fail (uvicorn is not a root test dependency).
This module is excluded from the root pyrefly lint env for the same reason
(see ``[tool.pyrefly] project_excludes`` in ``pyproject.toml``).
