"""Load/soak scenario catalogue — TH-1.5 (#474 · epic #462, design §4 S1-S12).

Each :class:`Scenario` is *data*: which token classes populate the replay pool,
what mock-OP failure injection to apply before the run, how much load to drive,
and which SLO gate (design §5) evaluates the result. The :mod:`runner` executes
a scenario; :mod:`pool` builds its token blend; :mod:`locustfile` drives it.

Scenarios are grouped into run **profiles**:

* ``CI_SHORT`` (S1, S2, S3, S6, S8) — the PR gate: short (~3s), deterministic,
  mock-OP-backed, self-contained (no Docker).
* ``DIAGNOSTIC`` (S5, S9, S10) — head-of-line / no-store / blocking-validator
  probes run on demand.
* ``NIGHTLY`` (S4, S7, S11, S12) — TTL-refresh / LRU-thrash / RSS-FD soak /
  multi-tenant runs. S4 lives here (not CI-short) because the cache enforces a
  60s minimum TTL (``core.jwks_cache.MIN_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS``), so a genuine
  TTL rollover cannot happen inside a ~3s CI-short window — it needs a >60s run.
* ``CAPACITY`` (C1, C2) — TH-4 breakpoint runs. Unlike every scenario above
  (which holds a fixed load), these carry a :class:`RampSpec` and walk the
  arrival rate up to the goodput knee; :func:`runner.run_capacity_scenario`
  drives them and records max-sustainable RPS + the knee. Co-located, so the
  knee is a directional ceiling + regression signal, not an absolute limit.

The SLO gate *thresholds* start unset (:mod:`runner` ``GATES``); the ``test``
phase runs a baseline, and the ``docs`` phase writes the calibrated table into
``README.md``. Until then the gates are permissive so a baseline run never fails
on an uncalibrated threshold.

    The fixed-hold scenarios (``ramp=None``) drive a *closed-loop* generator —
    a fixed user count firing back-to-back — which self-throttles as latency
    rises and so hides the knee. A ramp instead holds a generous **paced** user
    pool and walks the *target arrival rate* upward one step at a time against
    the same warm RS, so offered load is controlled and the point where goodput
    stops tracking it (the knee) becomes visible.

    Each step offers ``target_rps`` for ``step_seconds`` by pacing every user at
    ``rps_per_user`` req/s (Locust ``constant_throughput``) and sizing the pool
    to ``target_rps / rps_per_user`` (see :meth:`users_for`) — a *rate-scaled*
    pool, not a fixed count. Fixed counts fail both ways: too few users cannot
    offer a high rate (a false generator-bound plateau), too many inflate p99
    with idle-greenlet queueing (measuring the generator, not the RS). A constant
    per-user pace keeps latency server-reflective at every rung. The runner walks
    ``start_rps → stop_rps`` in ``step_rps`` increments and stops at the first
    step that breaches (goodput plateau, p99 ceiling, or error budget), recording
    the last sustained step as the knee.

    Attributes:
        start_rps: First offered arrival rate (req/s).
        stop_rps: Last offered arrival rate; the ladder never exceeds it.

        min_users: Floor on the pool so low rungs still have a few users.

            drops below ``sustain_ratio * target_rps`` — the primary,
            machine-independent knee signal (one core has a finite verify rate).
