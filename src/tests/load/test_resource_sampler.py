"""Deterministic unit coverage for the soak RSS/FD sampler — T313 (epic #462).

Pure-logic tests over the sampler: the summarize math (start/max/end, dead-sample
filtering), the :class:`ResourceSample` leak-signal properties, live sampling of
this very process, and the not-sampled (dead-pid) path. No booted RS and no Locust
— the real soak sampling is exercised in ``test_load_nightly.py``. Marked ``unit``
so it runs in the coverage-gated suite (psutil is a ``dev`` dependency).
