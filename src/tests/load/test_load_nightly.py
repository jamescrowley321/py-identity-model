"""Real-Locust nightly soak proof for the load suite — TH-1.5 (#271, epic #462).

The scheduled counterpart to :mod:`test_load_ci_short`. Runs the NIGHTLY scenario
profile (S4 TTL-rollover — needs a >60s window past the 60s cache-TTL floor — plus
the S7 LRU-thrash and S11/S12 RSS/FD soak scenarios) with the same real-Locust-vs-
booted-RS machinery, but the long-window work that does not belong on the PR gate.

Scheduled by ``.github/workflows/nightly.yml``; run on demand via
``make test-harness-load-nightly`` under ``uv run --group load --all-packages``.

Self-contained (the controllable mock OP is the failure-injection driver — no
external IdP). See :mod:`test_load_ci_short` for why locust is never imported in
this process (gevent ``monkey.patch_all`` would deadlock the in-process mock OP).
