"""
Proves the cache uses per-URI locks rather than a single global lock that
serializes upstream fetches across unrelated issuers.

Pre-fix: a single ``threading.Lock`` (sync) / ``asyncio.Lock`` (async) was
held *across* the upstream HTTP fetch in ``_get_cached_jwks`` /
``_get_disco_response`` / ``_refresh_jwks``. A request fetching JWKS from
``https://idp-a/jwks`` blocked every other request fetching JWKS from any
*other* address until the first request's network round-trip completed.

In a multi-tenant FastAPI app with multiple issuers and a slow upstream
(or one with a momentary glitch) this serialized the entire process on the
slowest fetch, regardless of which issuer the slowness affected.

Post-fix: the cache uses cache-aside with per-URI lock striping (32
stripes). Fetches for distinct URIs run in parallel; only fetches for the
*same* URI serialize, which is the actual single-flight contract.

The tests use a slow handler (sleep) to prove parallelism by wall-clock
total time. We allow a slack margin for scheduling jitter, but the
serialized vs. parallel times differ by ~2x — well outside any noise.

    of the test, side-stepping ``PYTHONHASHSEED``-driven stripe collisions.

    Runtime stripe selection is ``hash(uri) % 32``. CPython's randomized
    string hashing means two distinct URIs collide on the same stripe with
    probability ~1/32 ≈ 3.1% per process — enough to flake any parallelism
    test that picks two URIs and asserts they run concurrently. Without
    this fixture, the test depends on luck of the hash seed; with it, the
    test is deterministic.

    Applied at the class level via ``pytestmark`` on every class whose
    tests assert distinct-URI parallelism (see #398). Single-URI tests in
    the same class technically don't need it — the fixture is a no-op for
    them — but applying class-wide guarantees future parallelism tests
    added to the class can't accidentally omit it.

    The runtime concern (production fetches for distinct URIs serializing
    on a stripe collision) is the same root cause but explicitly out of
    scope for #398. A follow-up may bump stripe count or switch to a
    ``WeakValueDictionary`` keyed by URI; this fixture only addresses the
    test-side flake.
