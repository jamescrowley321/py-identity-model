"""
Regression coverage for #399: ``aio/token_validation.py`` must not bind
its cache locks to whichever event loop happens to import the module
first.

Pre-fix: module-level ``asyncio.Lock()`` instances bound to the first
loop that called ``.acquire()`` (Python 3.10+ semantics). Test runners
or embeds that create a new loop per scope (``asyncio.new_event_loop()``,
ASGI servers with custom loop policies, uvicorn workers that recreate
loops between requests) hit:

    RuntimeError: <asyncio.locks.Lock object at 0x...> is bound to a
    different event loop

Post-fix: locks are stored in a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed by the
running event loop and created lazily on first use within that loop.
Each loop sees its own independent lock set; entries are reclaimed when
a loop is garbage-collected.

These tests exercise the multi-loop scenario directly:

1. Run a validation flow on loop A.
2. Close loop A and open a fresh loop B.
3. Run the same operations on loop B without the dreaded RuntimeError.

The pre-fix code raises on step 3; the post-fix code completes both
flows cleanly.
