"""Cross-language /spec vector-coverage gate (CONS-1.5, AC-CONS-1.5.2/1.5.3).

Runs each language's thin conformance runner (Python, Go, Rust) against the
shared ``spec/conformance`` vectors with ``SPEC_COVERAGE_OUT`` set, then
verifies every language executed every executable vector case id. Any missing
(language, vector-id) pair fails the gate by name; success prints a 100%
per-language coverage report.

Native-executed cases (``execution: "native"`` in the spec — behaviours a
static vector cannot express) must carry a per-language native-test anchor in
the language's report; the runners themselves verify the anchors point at real
tests.

Usage:
    uv run python tools/spec_coverage_gate.py            # run runners + gate
    uv run python tools/spec_coverage_gate.py --check-only <reports-dir>

Today ``validation.json`` is the only capability with executable vectors; as
more capabilities gain vectors, extend RUNNERS' report emission to one file
per capability and this inventory loop picks them up.
