"""
Mutual-TLS (mTLS) Client Authentication + Certificate-Bound Tokens (RFC 8705)

Demonstrates the second FAPI 2.0 sender-constraining path (DPoP is the first;
see ``dpop_example.py``): the client authenticates by presenting an X.509
certificate at the TLS layer instead of a client secret, and the authorization
server issues access tokens bound to that certificate's thumbprint.

Flow:
1. Generate a self-signed client certificate + key pair (for real deployments
   use a CA-issued cert for ``tls_client_auth`` or any cert for
   ``self_signed_tls_client_auth``; see ``examples/cert-generator``).
2. Build an ``MtlsClientAuth`` config and attach it to a token request. Observe
   that the request uses no ``Authorization`` header — ``client_id`` goes in the
   body and the certificate is presented at the TLS layer (RFC 8705 §2).
3. Route requests through ``mtls_endpoint_aliases`` when the AS advertises them
   (RFC 8705 §5).
4. Validate a certificate-bound access token's ``cnf["x5t#S256"]`` confirmation
   against the presented client certificate (RFC 8705 §3).
