"""Real-Locust CI-short proof for the load suite — TH-1.5 (#474, epic #462).

This is the ``test`` phase's DoD entrypoint: a REAL Locust run (programmatic,
headless) driving the booted resource server (real uvicorn subprocess, real HTTP)
with the pre-minted replay pool, over the CI_SHORT scenario profile
(S1, S2, S3, S6, S8). A green *unit* run is not proof — this drives actual load
and scores real responses. (S4 TTL-rollover needs a >60s window per the 60s cache
TTL floor and lives in NIGHTLY; S5/S9/S10 are DIAGNOSTIC.)

Self-contained: the controllable mock OP is the design's failure-injection driver
(latency, key rotation, contention), so no external IdP is needed. The suite skips
cleanly in a plain unit env (``locust``/fastapi absent); run it via
``make test-harness-load`` under ``uv run --group load --all-packages``.

The ``locust`` availability check uses :func:`importlib.util.find_spec` and does
NOT import locust in this process: importing locust triggers gevent's
``monkey.patch_all()``, which would deadlock the in-process asyncio mock-OP server
thread the runner boots. Locust only ever runs in the runner's subprocess.

    The authoritative proof is the mock-OP upstream counters (reset after the

    The RS-side per-process cache counters have no reset route, so they still
    carry the single cold warmup miss (one discovery + one JWKS fetch, coalesced
    by single-flight). The warm invariant is therefore that the measured window
    added NO misses of its own: discovery and JWKS misses stay at their
    cold-start bound of one each while hits accrue. That is asserted directly on
    the miss counts rather than via a hit *rate*, because a hit rate is
    volume-sensitive — ``hits / (hits + 2)`` only clears 0.99 once the window has
    driven ~200 requests. A slow, contended CI runner can spin the first Locust
    subprocess up so late that only a handful of requests land in the window; the
    lone warmup miss then dominates the cumulative rate and false-fails a cache
    that is genuinely warm. Bounding the miss counts is request-count-independent
