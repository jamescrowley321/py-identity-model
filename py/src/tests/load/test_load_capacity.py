"""Real-Locust capacity/breakpoint proof for the load suite — TH-4.

This is the capacity ``test``-phase DoD: a REAL open-model ramp (Locust paced
via ``constant_throughput``) driving the booted RS (real uvicorn subprocess,
real HTTP) up the arrival-rate ladder until goodput stops tracking offered load
— the knee. A green fixed-load run is not proof of a capacity limit; this drives
load to saturation and records where the single worker falls over.

The knee is a *co-located, directional* ceiling (generator + mock OP + RS share
the box, per the design's accepted trade-off) plus a regression signal — NOT the
RS's absolute isolated limit, which needs a deployed target. The assertions here
pin the *mechanism* (goodput plateaus **when** a knee is found, zero 5xx under
saturation, monotonic offered rate, the curve renders), never a machine-specific
RPS number — and never that a breakpoint *must* exist within the ladder. On this
co-located config a fast runner can sustain the whole ladder (clean exhaustion)
and a contended one can plateau at rung 1; both are valid, reported outcomes (the
knee is Track-B directional data per ``sprint-change-proposal-2026-08-19.md``, not
a shared-CI pass/fail), so requiring a breakpoint would false-fail on runner noise.

Self-contained and skips cleanly without the load group (see the CI-short suite
for why locust must not be imported in-process). Run via
``make test-harness-load-capacity`` under ``uv run --group load --all-packages``.
